# mapedit 0.3.0

### API Changes

* **BREAKING** editFeatures and selectFeatures add a map argument
instead of platform

### New Features

* add editFeatures function for easy add, edit, delete with existing simple features (sf)
* add editMap.NULL
* add record argument to edit* functions to preserve the series
of actions from an editing session.  If `record = TRUE` then a `"recorder"` attribute will be added to the returned object for
full reproducibility.
* add internal playback for recorded session for future use
* add viewer argument to select and edit functions to allow
user the flexibility to adjust the viewer experience.  Default
will be paneViewer() in an attempt to keep the workflow
within one RStudio window/context.
* change height to 97% to fill viewer
* document more thoroughly
* pass trial CRAN check
